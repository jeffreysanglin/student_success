# Student Success and Failure Lookalike Project
## Intro
School is one of the best ways to raise individuals' earnings potentials. If we can identify students who are at risk in school, it's possible we could intervene beforehand. If we can identify "lookalike's" of students that fail, we could intervene with these students and tailor solutions based on identifiers.

_"A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic sucess. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes._

## Problem Statement
In 2023 about 9.5% of students were "early leavers" in EU from education and training. This can be a critical moment for individuals' career success. This is much higher for men than women. Most early leavers do not have work when they leave. _Source: [EU Eurostate](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Early_leavers_from_education_and_traininghttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Early_leavers_from_education_and_training)_.

## Proposed Solution
If we can identify students who are at risk of dropout in higher education, it's possible institutions could intervene beforehand or better prepare students for the education journey. It could also help institutions predict which students will be successful in higher ed.

## Dataset
The Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre and SATDAP (Capacitação da Administração Pública) created a dataset to identify which students would graduate or leave their institution. _Note: While this group certainly did their own prediction, I have not and will not read the paper until after I complete my own data model._
